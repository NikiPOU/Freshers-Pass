# Art App
The Art App is designed to provide an unbiased platform for artists to share their in sight art to spectators.
In sight art refers to art that is either physical, or performative art taking place in the physical environment.
The application is built with Python and Flask. It allows artists and spectators to create user accounts. 
User status will be granted based on their roles (artist/spectator), with the possibility of verified status for artists.
One of the key components of this app is a map feature to find artists' works. Additionally, the app will have a rating system, 
a search function for users and art type, and a schegule/timetable for the art.

## Features

- **User Roles**: Accounts for artists and spectators.
- **Verified Artists**: Artists can apply for verified status.
- **Schedule**: For upcoming shows nearby/artist schegule.
- **Map View**: See artists' works on a map, including schegule times.
- **Art Types**: Type of art, (ex. physical or performative).
- **Rating System**: Users can rate artworks.
